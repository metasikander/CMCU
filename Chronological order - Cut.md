# Strict chronological order of every film, episode and short by cutting into the original material

Fill inn the source material, when the clip should start and when it should end, and the approximate date for when the clip is happening in the MCU.

I do not recommend watching the MCU in this fashion before you have seen it in its original form first. The original material was made as it is for a reason.
